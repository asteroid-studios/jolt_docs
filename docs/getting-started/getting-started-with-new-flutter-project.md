# Getting Started with New Flutter Project


## Your environment

Make sure you have already completed your [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installation, as well as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Also, install these [VS Code Extensions](/ide/vscode/#recommended-extensions) if you haven't already.


## Creating a new project

Navigate into the newly created project directoy, and create a new flutter project.

```
cd /path/to/project/directory
flutter create .
```

## Add essential project dependencies

In your project's pubspec.yaml file, you'll need to add some key dependencies. This will vary depending on what backend you want to use. Go to [the next page](/getting-started/selecting-your-backend/) to help you make a decision on what backend best suits your mobile app project.
