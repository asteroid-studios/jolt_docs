# Getting Started

> ### Jolt is a collection of Flutter packages, designed to standardise and supercharge the process of developing cross-platform apps.

## Your Environment

Make sure you have already completed your [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installation, as well as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Also, install these [VS Code Extensions](../vscode/suggested-extensions.md) if you haven't already.

## Jolt CLI

The easiest way to get started using Jolt is to install and activate the **Jolt CLI**.

```bash
flutter pub global activate jolt_cli
```

## Creating a new project

To create a flutter project in the current directory:

```bash
jolt create project
```

Note: By default it will take the folder's name as project name

You can name the project with `jolt create project:my_project`

If the name has spaces use `jolt create project:"my cool project"`
